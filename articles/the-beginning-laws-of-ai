# The Beginning laws of Artificial Intelligence

These are a group of laws or rules that I think exist independent of A.I. but however apply in the application of A.I. I will start with the list and then make my case for their existance below. They are as follows:

##### These I consider Laws
 
 * Nothing can create something greater than its' own capacity
 * Human language cannot be learned unsupervised
 
##### These are more rules of a good learner, but still apply.
 
 * A good learner knows when to ask and when to assume
 * It is better to honestly represent what you know than to show a false assumption
